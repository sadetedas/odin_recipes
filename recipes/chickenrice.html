        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>My favorite food of all time! Don't be fooled by the simple ingredients. The secret is in the broth: this is the most amazing, flavorsome Chinese chicken rice dish you've ever tried. Garnish with sliced cucumber, sprigs of spring onions, and cilantro.</p>

        <p>The rich flavour of the rice comes from the grains that have been pre-fried in chicken fat and then cooked in chicken broth.6 The chicken is steamed until it is just cooked, with a little pink remaining on the flesh near the bones. While the cut chicken is presented on a large dish, the rice is served on individual plates. The dish is accompanied with a chilli sauce made of chillies, chicken broth, garlic and ginger. A thick broth of chicken stock, garnished with a sprinkle of spring onions and coriander leaves, is also a must.</p>

        <p>An early version of the dish featured rice compacted into balls. The rice balls were made of shorter-grained rice, and cooked with pandan leaves and ginger slices over a controlled fire. The rice is then shaped into balls with bare hands before it goes cold. This version of the dish is seldom seen in Singapore now.</p>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Trim chicken of all excess fat, reserving fat.</li>
            <li>Place chicken, spring onion, 3 cloves crushed garlic, and one 1-inch piece ginger in a large pot. Pour in enough water to cover. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to low and simmer, skimming any scum off the surface, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone, reads 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Remove chicken from the pot, reserving broth. Rub chicken with salt. Chop into pieces and arrange on a serving plate.</li>
            <li>Combine soy sauce, 3 tablespoons reserved chicken broth, 1 1/2 tablespoon sugar, garlic oil, and sesame oil in a small bowl. Drizzle over chicken pieces.</li>
            <l>Melt reserved chicken fat in a large pot over medium heat. Add rice, 3 cloves minced garlic, crushed 1-inch piece ginger, and salt; cook and stir until rice is glossy and fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes.</l>
            <li>Pour enough reserved chicken broth into the pot to cover rice by half an inch. Cover; bring to a boil. Cook until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. Let rice sit, covered, for 5 minutes. Fluff with a fork.</li>
            <li>Combine red chile peppers, juice of 2 limes, 2 tablespoons reserved chicken broth, 3 cloves garlic, one 1/2-inch piece ginger, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1 pinch sugar in a blender; blend until garlic chile dip is smooth.</li>
            <li>Combine juice of 2 limes, 2 tablespoons reserved chicken broth, 3 cloves garlic, one 1-inch piece ginger, and 1/8 teaspoon salt in a blender; blend until ginger dip is smooth.</li>
            <li>Serve garlic chile and ginger dips alongside chicken and rice.</li>
